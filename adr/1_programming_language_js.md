# Programming Language - javaScript

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As this milestone requires some processing of the json file, a programming language is needed. However there are not many widespread alternatives right now:

- javaScript
- typeScript

## Decision

As we only need the most basic functionalities, typeScript would be "over the top". So javascript is choosen as language.

## Consequences

### Pros
- keeps project light
- no configuration needed
- still possible to change to typeScript
- no additional packages needed
- error tracing may be easier
### Cons
- no type safety
- less IDE help
