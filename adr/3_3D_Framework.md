# 3D Framework -

## Status



## Context

As mentioned in milestone 3, a 3D-timeline needs to be created. For that matter the techstack needs to be expanded (with one exception). Possible solutions could include these:

- [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/)
- [three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [babylon.js](https://www.babylonjs.com/)
- [Unity Engine](https://unity.com/de)

## Decision
All of the solutions are based on webGL. So why not use webgl? Creating 3D-Engines is a very time consuming work. As the author already created engines with openGL this is a lesson learned. To create a solution in a timely matter, a framework would be helpful. 
However babylon.js and Unity are both suitable, but focus more on game development. Also while there is already knowledge in Unity, it is way to overloaded for the simple task. Furthermore three js has, just as unity, a broad use, big community and is well documented. 
Therefore three.js is choosen. 

## Consequences

### Pros
- light framework 
- a lot of functionality already provided
- good documentation / examples
### Cons
- More training time needed
